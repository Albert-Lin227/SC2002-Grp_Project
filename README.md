# SC2002-Grp_Project

This is the repository that contains the files required for the SC2002 Group Project.



## Getting Started


1. Download the StudentMgr file by clicking on the “<> Code” button —> Download ZIP. Alternatively, you can open with GitHub Desktop


2. Copy/drag the file to <your directory>/eclipse-workspace.

3. If you want to obtain the individual files, you may go to StudentMgr/src/h inside the downloaded StudentMgr file, and copy all the .java files present in this directory into another folder for ease of access.*


*You can import the Java class files into the IDE you're currently using for testing purposes. Eclipse IDE was used in the creation of these class files.
